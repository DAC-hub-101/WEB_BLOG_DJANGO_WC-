INSERT INTO `blog_post` VALUES (1,'AI Etics','What are ethics in AI?\r\n\r\nAI ethics is a system of moral principles and techniques intended to inform the development and responsible use of artificial intelligence technology. As AI has become integral to products and services, organizations are starting to develop AI codes of ethics.\r\n\r\nAn AI code of ethics, also called an AI value platform, is a policy statement that formally defines the role of artificial intelligence as it applies to the continued development of the human race. The purpose of an AI code of ethics is to provide stakeholders with guidance when faced with an ethical decision regarding the use of artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nIsaac Asimov, the science fiction writer, foresaw the potential dangers of autonomous AI agents long before their development and created The Three Laws of Robotics as a means of limiting those risks. In Asimov\'s code of ethics, the first law forbids robots from actively harming humans or allowing harm to come to humans by refusing to act. The second law orders robots to obey humans unless the orders are not in accordance with the first law. The third law orders robots to protect themselves insofar as doing so is in accordance with the first two laws.\r\n\r\nThe rapid advancement of AI in the past five to 10 years has spurred groups of experts to develop safeguards for protecting against the risk of AI to humans. One such group is the nonprofit institute founded by MIT cosmologist Max Tegmark, Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn and DeepMind research scientist Victoria Krakovna. The institute worked with AI researchers and developers as well as scholars from many disciplines to create the 23 guidelines now referred to as the Asilomar AI Principles.','2022-02-17 22:28:51.665697',1),(2,'How to Upgrade Python to 3.9','Every minor version of Python, that is any 3.x and 2.x version, will install side-by-side with other versions on your computer. Only patch versions will upgrade existing installations.\r\n\r\nSo if you want to keep your installed Python 2.7 around, then just let it and install a new version using the installer. If you want to get rid of Python 2.7, you can uninstall it before or after installing a newer version—there is no difference to this.\r\n\r\nCurrent Python 3 installations come with the py.exe launcher, which by default is installed into the system directory. This makes it available from the PATH, so you can automatically run it from any shell just by using py instead of python as the command. This avoids you having to put the current Python installation into PATH yourself. That way, you can easily have multiple Python installations side-by-side without them interfering with each other. When running, just use py script.py instead of python script.py to use the launcher. You can also specify a version using for example py -3 or py -3.6 to launch a specific version, otherwise the launcher will use the current default (which will usually be the latest 3.x).\r\n\r\nUsing the launcher, you can also run Python 2 scripts (which are often syntax incompatible to Python 3), if you decide to keep your Python 2.7 installation. Just use py -2 script.py to launch a script.','2022-02-17 22:30:09.199987',1),(3,'Chip','CHIP\r\nC.H.I.P Board, back face\r\nCHIP board, rear side\r\n\r\nCHIP was the original board, mostly targeting hobbyists. The system is built around the Allwinner R8 SoC processor, which integrates an ARM Cortex-A8 CPU (based on ARM architecture V7-A) and peripherals, such as Graphic Engine, UART, SPI, USB ports, CIR, CMOS Sensor Interface and LCD controller.[14] The CPU is also accompanied by a NEON SIMD coprocessor and has RCT JAVA-Accelerations to optimize just-in-time (JIT) and dynamic adaptive compilation (DAC). There is also an ARM Mali-400 GPU, and a x263,x264 and vp8 hardware video decoder in the R8.[15]\r\n\r\nCHIP was upgraded in April 2017 in anticipation of the CHIP Pro to \"share a large number of the same components\".[12]\r\n\r\nFeatures implemented on this model:\r\n\r\n    Built-in Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0\r\n    One USB host with type-A receptacle, one USB On-The-Go port\r\n    Composite video and stereo audio port via mini TRRS\r\n    Optional composite TRRS to RCA audio-video cable\r\n    Optional VGA adapter and HDMI adapter (see Hardware extensions below)\r\n    Open source hardware[16] and open source software[17]\r\n    Up to 45 GPIO ports[18]\r\n    Supports 1-Wire and I2C protocols, PWM output\r\n    Serial console and Ethernet via USB for quick headless operation[19]\r\n    Power options include 5V via USB OTG, 5V via CHN pin, and by 3.7 battery\r\n    Onboard NAND storage, 4-8GB,[5][6] pre-installed Linux OS (Debian)[3][17]\r\n    Web-based firmware update[20]\r\n\r\nThe CHIP is 60 mm × 40 mm in size.[21]\r\nCHIP Pro\r\n\r\nCHIP Pro is similar to the original CHIP board, but uses the newer GR8 version of the chip. It is a system in package (SiP) made by Next Thing Co. It features a 1 GHz Allwinner R8 ARMv7 Cortex-A8 processor with NEON SIMD extensions and a Mali-400 GPU. 256 MB of Nanya Technology DDR3 SDRAM is combined with the R8 SoC into a 14 mm × 14 mm, 0.8 mm-pitch 252-ball FBGA package, simplifying the routing of connections. Instead of having two dual-line 40-pin sockets as on CHIP, it implements castellated edges where the pin holes are designed and optimized to embed to another board with SMT.[22] Most of the CHIP\'s hardware features are also included in this model.\r\nCHIP \"v2\" (unreleased)\r\n\r\nFew details were available in regard to CHIP\'s would-be successor or successors except it would have used Next Thing\'s own SiP GR8 instead of Allwinner\'s original R8. In addition to feature-sharing with CHIP Pro, the company wanted to \"take advantage of CHIP Pro\'s much more stable supply chain\"[12] in order to address the uneasiness in its user base about the future of the product.[23] In responding to user concerns, Next Thing also disclosed that more than one successor product line was in the works.[24]\r\n\r\nAs Next Thing Co. entered insolvency with its assets and intellectual properties being sold,[13] release of \"v2\" is improbable.','2022-02-17 22:39:58.009335',2),(4,'Hardware extensions','In addition to open-source hardware and software, Next Thing also published an HPI and an API for users to develop add-ons boards called \"DIP\" The company produced several DIPs including the Pocket CHIP.\r\nPocket CHIP and Pockulus\r\nA PocketCHIP.\r\n\r\nPocket CHIP includes a CHIP, a case with a 4.3 inch 480×272 pixel resistive touchscreen, a clicky keyboard, GPIO headers on the top of the device, and GPIO soldering pads inside of the injection mold case. A 5-hour battery is included. Following DIP specifications, the CHIP snaps into the case with no \"screws or glues\" creating a portable computer. On the lower right corner of the Pocket CHIP is a hexagonal hole that takes a standard #2 HB pencil. Inserting the pencil creates a stand that allows the Pocket CHIP to stand upright on a desk. Likewise, on the lower left is a circular hole for a pen.\r\n\r\nPocketCHIP comes loaded with a special edition of CHIP OS that includes the DIP\'s driver and a couple of additional applications, including a special version of video game console virtual machine Pico-8, a fully functional Linux terminal, a file browser, a terminal based web browser called surf, and modular synthesizer Sunvox.\r\n\r\nThe Pockulus is a virtual reality setup incorporating a Pocket CH.I.P. that requires some 3D printing.\r\nOther DIPs from Next Thing\r\n\r\nFor users who did not want to use the small screen in Pocket CHIP and also did not want to use the built-in composite TV output, Next Thing sold a VGA DIP[26] and an HDMI DIP. Unlike Pocket CHIP, physical dimensions of these DIPs are similar to CHIP, so the snapped assembly looks like a thicker CHIP.\r\nMedia coverage and user community\r\n\r\nCHIP received favorable reviews, and constant comparisons to Raspberry Pi. Laura Sydell of NPR asked if the device could \"spark a new wave of tinkering and innovation\", noting it was also open source hardware.[28] Marco della Cava of USA Today said that the device \"represent[s] opportunities to both close the technology gap in developing and developed countries alike, while encouraging children to learn coding, due to their approachable design\".\r\n\r\nReviewers also noted its low price. Bo Moore of PC Gamer said the price of CHIP \"[puts] Raspberry Pi 2 to shame\", and Ian Paul of PCWorld said it made \"Raspberry Pi\'s price seem luxurious\".[31] Within days of the launch of its Kickstarter, US national media outlets like The Washington Post and Time followed with glowing coverage.[32][33] Even Fortune joined the chorus with headline \"This $9 computer could change the economics of building hardware.\"\r\n\r\nSince its alpha shipping, CHIP has attracted an enthusiastic user base, communicating mainly on NTC\'s bulletin board system (BBS). At the time of NTC\'s demise, the BBS had over 10,000 users, with hundreds of active users and hundreds of postings every month, to a total of over 100,000.\r\n\r\nDespite enthusiasm from reviewers and users, Next Thing Co. declared bankruptcy in March 2018, leaving many pre-order customers with undelivered orders.\r\nArchives and continuing support\r\n\r\nWhile NTC has published many of its hardware and software repositories on GitHub, surviving CHIPsters (as CHIP users call themselves[citation needed]) also launched an effort in order to preserve useful document, software, and other artifacts by leveraging the Internet Archive (a.k.a. archive.org). One effort is led by a user who has never received his preordered CHIP.[36] Another user set up a standalone site focusing on binary packages and a Git repository.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the community also has a Wiki site that is independent of NTC. However, as of 2021, the website ceased to function. The original content is however available in the Internet Archive snapshot[39] from November 2020.','2022-02-17 22:43:10.988834',2),(5,'Python History','Python was conceived in the late 1980s[39] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[40] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[10] Its implementation began in December 1989.[41] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from his responsibilities as Python\'s \"benevolent dictator for life\", a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project\'s chief decision-maker.[42] In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member \"Steering Council\" to lead the project.[43][44]\r\n\r\nPython 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector (in addition to reference counting) for memory management and support for Unicode.[45]\r\n\r\nPython 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible.[46] Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x[47] and 2.7.x version series. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[48]\r\n\r\nPython 2.7\'s end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[49][50] No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[51][52] With Python 2\'s end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x[53] and later are supported.\r\n\r\nPython 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited[54] as all versions of Python (including 2.7[55]) had security issues leading to possible remote code execution[56] and web cache poisoning.[57]','2022-02-17 22:44:10.250981',2),(6,'Python Design philosophy and features','Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming[58] and metaobjects (magic methods)).[59] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[60][61] and logic programming.[62]\r\n\r\nPython uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.[63] It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.\r\n\r\nPython\'s design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter,mapandreduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.[64] The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.[65]\r\n\r\nThe language\'s core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:[66]\r\n\r\n    Beautiful is better than ugly.\r\n    Explicit is better than implicit.\r\n    Simple is better than complex.\r\n    Complex is better than complicated.\r\n    Readability counts.\r\n\r\nRather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible (with modules). This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum\'s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.[39]\r\n\r\nPython strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl\'s \"there is more than one way to do it\" motto, Python embraces a \"there should be one— and preferably only one —obvious way to do it\" design philosophy.[66] Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, writes that \"To describe something as \'clever\' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture.\"[67]\r\n\r\nPython\'s developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.[68] When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or use PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.\r\n\r\nPython\'s developers aim for the language to be fun to use. This is reflected in its name—a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python[69]—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs (a reference to a Monty Python sketch) instead of the standard foo and bar.[70][71]\r\n\r\nA common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python\'s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.[72][73]\r\n\r\nUsers and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as Pythonistas.[74][75]','2022-02-17 22:44:50.864066',2);
